# Reflection for Godot 4.0

[![Screenshot of Reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Calinou/media/master/godot-reflection/screenshot-thumb.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Calinou/media/master/godot-reflection/screenshot.png)

A port of [Tesseract](http://tesseract.gg)'s Reflection map for testing Godot 4.0's new renderer.
Uses GIProbe for global illumination in addition to volumetric fog.

The OBJ and MTL files were sourced from [game-maps-obj](https://github.com/Calinou/game-maps-obj).

## Try it out

### Installation

Clone the Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Calinou/godot-reflection.git
```

You can also
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/Calinou/godot-reflection/archive/master.zip)
if you don't have Git installed.

**You need a development build of Godot 4.0 to run this demo.**

Once you have the project files, open the Godot Project Manager, click the
**Import** button, then select the `project.godot` file of this project.
Confirm importing, then edit the project (so that the resources are imported
by the editor). Exit the editor (go back to the project manager), then run
the project. This is to make sure the editor does not render the demo in
the background, which would slow down the running project a lot.

**Note:** If some materials don't show up, try selecting
`reflection/models/reflection.obj` in the FileSystem dock, go to the Import dock then
click **Reimport**.
